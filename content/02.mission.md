Core facilities serve as a source of expertise in a particular field/topic to be shared amongst investigators. In the case of bioinformatics, the core facility is to provide expertise in computational analysis of biological datasets encompassing the fields of genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and imaging based datasets. This includes operational know-how for computational tools, balancing hardware requirements for computational tools, benchmarking comparative computational tools, understanding the data generation techniques, and executing analyses. By leveraging the Core's expertise with these topics, investigators will be enabled to generate biologically driven discoveries.
