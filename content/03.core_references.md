## Example Bioinformatics Cores {.page_break_before}

Various core facilities for bioinformatics have utilized their own solutions for implementation.

### List of examples:

- [The Applied Bioinformatics Laboratories at NYU](https://med.nyu.edu/research/scientific-cores-shared-resources/applied-bioinformatics-laboratories). This core facility offers services in a variation of the semi-centralized model. Staff are provided on a percent effort basis, scaling in 20% increments to essentially "rent" out the staff member to the respective lab for 1 day per 20% incremement per week [@https://med.nyu.edu/research/scientific-cores-shared-resources/applied-bioinformatics-laboratories].
- [The Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core](https://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu/). This core facility offers standard services, but is renowned for their training capabilities [@https://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu/].
- [The UCSD Bioinformatics Core](http://compbio.ucsd.edu/services/). This core has multiple branches and generally runs on an hourly staff rate. In addition, they have an extension with a well known training program that funds many of their services [@https://extension.ucsd.edu/courses-and-programs/applied-bioinformatics].
- [The Bioinformatics Core at the University of Michigan](https://brcf.medicine.umich.edu/cores/bioinformatics-core/). This is a more traditional fee-for-service designed core facility, with basic pipeline services offered with additional add ons at cost. This core also has spawned at least one major bioinformatics company- [Advaita](https://advaitabio.com/) [@https://brcf.medicine.umich.edu/cores/bioinformatics-core/;@https://advaitabio.com/].
- [The University of Maryland Bioinformatics Core](http://biology.umd.edu/services.html). This core is a classic core facility offering hourly and per-project rates for pipelined services [@https://advaitabio.com/].
- [UT Southwestern Bioinformatics Core](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/bioinformatics/). This core has a slightly different spin on services, offering their staff as "on-demand" for FTE coverage, or as "in-residence" with salary coverage for a full year [@https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/bioinformatics/].
- [The BSR at VIGR at UVM](https://www.med.uvm.edu/vigr/bioinformatics). Another slightly different take on a core, the Bioinformatics Shared Resource is nested within the Vermont Integrated Genomics Resource at UVM. This core charges an hourly rate to cover staff time operating on genomics workflows [@https://www.med.uvm.edu/vigr/bioinformatics].
- [Genomics and Informatics Core at MIT](https://cehs.mit.edu/core-facilities/genomics-and-informatics-facilities-core). This core also provides staff on an hourly rate to investigators, though they provide different costings for those who have invested in the core facility or provide staff [@https://cehs.mit.edu/core-facilities/genomics-and-informatics-facilities-core].
