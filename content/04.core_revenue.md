## Core Revenue Streams {.page_break_before}

This Core will focus on 4 primary revenue streams to both cover operational costs and provide for growth of the Core. These four revenue streams are designed to operate in synergy to meet the mission of the core. 

All project consultation will be provided free of any charge. 

### Fee per operation Services

Fee per operation services will be primarily prescribed functions and automated for maximum efficiency. These will involve upfront time investment, but long term will provide staff availability to focus on collaborative services focused on biological interpretation. 

#### Primary Data Analysis

The first facet of fee per operation would be primary data analysis. Many raw data outputs are natively human-unreadable. The primary data analysis will at minimum convert machine raw data to common data formats and/or human readable data structures. This will become a standard add-on to all data generating facilities services, and will be priced as an absolute minimum- covering purely the computational costs associated with the processing. These will be designed for standardizing output of data for other pre-defined pipelines, ease of staff use for collaborative usage, and input to SaaS tools. 

Example: Transcriptome analysis
- bcl to FASTQ conversion and demultiplexing to individual samples for NGS approaches
- Transcriptome alignment from FASTQ to bam files
- Differential gene expression analysis to human readable CSV (excel) files. 

#### Pre-defined Pipelines

The second facet to fee per operation would be some automated secondary data analysis. This is comparable to many contract research organization (CRO) offerings for analysis. All outputs will be explicitely pre-defined. 

Example: Transcriptome analysis + visualizations
- bcl to FASTQ conversion and demultiplexing to individual samples for NGS approaches
- Transcriptome alignment from FASTQ to bam files
- Differential gene expression analysis to human readable CSV (excel) files. 
- Principal component analysis and global hierarchal clustering
- Per-comparison volcano plots
- Heatmaps for top differentially expressed genes
- Basic Pathway analysis

### Training Services

Training services will be offered to increase the bioinformatics education level of university members. In alignment with traditional open-source values, **all** training materials will be made open-access. Charges will only be incurred for staffed courses. 

#### Prescribed courses

Prescribed courses will be developed for standard bioinformatics education. These will involve an initial time investment, but once developed will require minimal maintenance to stay up-to-date. Additionally, these courses can be made in-person, virtual, or interactive depending upon the topic involved. These will be offered at a regular interval, and potentially could grow in to a revenue stream of degree courses.

#### Spot courses

Spot courses will be offered at a higher rate than prescribed courses. These will be custom designed for investigators requests on bioinformatics techniques. For example, if a laboratory wishes to learn more about alignment algorithms but no prescribed course covers these topics, one will be developed and provided to the investigator's group.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

Software as a Service is designed to enable investigators to perform biological analyses using informatically developed tools. There are an increasing number of companies exclusively designed around SaaS for bioinformatics, such as [Partek](https://www.partek.com/), [Basepair](https://www.basepairtech.com/), [Rosalind](https://www.onramp.bio/). This will be an in-house developed effort, designed both for customization and individualization of tools, as well as reduced costs compared to corporate efforts. The key is the core provides the bioinformatics expertise to manage the tools, the parent organization (IE OARC) can provide infrastructure, and the investigator provides their biological expertise. 

#### Access subscription

This will generate revenue in a subscription style. Individual investigator's labs, departments, or major centers can purchase subscriptions for their members. 

Examples:
- RNA-seq Shiny app. Investigators can take differentially expressed gene matrices (generated automatically in primary processing pipeline), and interogate their data at further depth with tools designed by bioinformaticians to enable their publication quality plot of data.
